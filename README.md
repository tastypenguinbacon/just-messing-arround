# Hi there!
This is my little commandline playground (or beter said firing range).  Keep 
your eyes pealed, there could be still some leftover landmines. 

## What the duck is that?
As stated before - it's a playground. There is nothing more to it, except the
fact it's mostly written and maintained using commandline tools.

## Why commandline tools? Wouldn't an IDE be better suited for that?
Of course it would! That's why they are used in corporate environments. This is
just a place for me to have fun. The great outdoors! 

## Motivation
Despite that - most of the tools which are well integrated with IDE's make the
developer feel overly comfortable to the spot where he or she forgets how to do
the simple things the correct way, leading to mostly platform dependend builds 
and creating APIs designed for smart code completion, resulting in trainwreck, 
hard to test code.

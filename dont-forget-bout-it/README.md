# DontForgetBoutIt

It's aimed to create an application aimed to share URLs to various pages which
you don't want to forget or you want to remember it for some reason.

# How the idea started?

I and a couple of friends started sending each other various articles which we 
ourselves didn't want to forget about. These were scattered over all messengers
and other places. I thought of it as a good coding practice - implementing a 
web service which could handle something like that for us.
